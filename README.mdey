I've Given The Link Below To See My Whole Website 👇.

https://monica112002.github.io/Dicee-Challenge---Starting-Files/

I have Created A Dice Game Website 🕹️, In Which You Can Play The Dice Game 🎲..

This Website Has Been Created Using HTML , CSS & Javascript.

In This Repository I Have Added A Image Folder 📁, Where You Can See All The Images 🖼️ I,ve Used In My Website.

Secondly There Is A Public Folder 📁,In That Folder I've Stored My .css File📄 & .js File📄. You Can Go Through It.

In That Same Public Folder Ive Added An Image Name Called Favicon Which Will Be The Icon Image At The Top Of My Website 🌐 Near The Title Tag.

Coming Down You Can See My index.html📄 File Where I've Stored All The Elements In It.

I've Used HTML For Writing My Content , CSS For Styling And Javascript For Functioning.

THANK YOU 🤗!
